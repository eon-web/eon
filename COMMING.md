## Plugin API
New feature for v1.15.0: Plugin API! This API allows users to create plugins that hook deep into the eon engine and provide additional functionality. It's also a way to get access to external libraries without violating the no-dependencies policy.
### Notes
This feature will require a deep rewrite of eon's source. A `plugins` branch will be used for this feature.
